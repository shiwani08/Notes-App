# Notes App

A simple notes application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to create, edit, delete, and star notes. It uses `localStorage` to save the notes so that they persist across page refreshes. Starred notes are also saved and can be viewed separately on a `starred.html` page.

## Features

- **Create Notes**: Add new notes by clicking the "Add Note" button.
- **Edit Notes**: Click the edit icon to switch between viewing and editing a note.
- **Delete Notes**: Remove notes by clicking the trash icon.
- **Star Notes**: Mark notes as "starred" by clicking the star icon. Starred notes are saved in `localStorage` and displayed separately on the `starred.html` page.
- **Persistent Data**: Notes are stored in `localStorage`, so they persist even after you refresh or close the browser.
